This project now builds and runs on Vercel, and the simulation functions within Next, albeit with some issues.

It displays the grid and updates the info panel when grid tiles are selected.
All the elements of class Building can be placed on the grid.
Vehicles appear and move on roads.

That's it.

Scrolling zooms in and out, but also scrolls up and down. That needs to stop.
Two games are created during development due to the React StrictMode meant to help you fix lifecycle bugs. Set "reactStrictMode" to false in next.config.js

The Pause button doesn't work.
Stubbed togglePause() function to squelch error.

I added an initial JsDoc typedef which would import types to avoid importing the same types repeatedly.

npm warns of these issues when installing locally:
npm WARN deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.
npm WARN deprecated @humanwhocodes/config-array@0.11.14: Use @eslint/config-array instead
npm WARN deprecated rimraf@3.0.2: Rimraf versions prior to v4 are no longer supported
npm WARN deprecated @humanwhocodes/object-schema@2.0.3: Use @eslint/object-schema instead
npm WARN deprecated glob@7.2.3: Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported

I also started work on migrating eslint to a more recent version (Eslint v9+) beginning with the eslintrc config file.

The project should also move to ES modules, although I don't believe anything is CommonJS (except for the .eslintrc.cjs config file).
