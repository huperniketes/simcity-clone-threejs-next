Although this project now builds and runs on Vercel, the game isn't functional within Next yet. It only displays the grid and updates
the info panel when grid tiles are selected.

Tool selection works in the menu, but isn't recognized by the Game instance. As a result, placing SimObjects doesn't work.
Another note on SimObjects: subclasses have x/y coordinates as parameters but are ignored so should be deleted.

The createBuilding() factory function should be deleted if buildingConstructor() works correctly.

Scrolling zooms in and out, but also scrolls up and down. That needs to stop.
TypeScript complains when I use regular JS imports for type definitions, but JsDoc requires type defs to be imported repeatedly for
the same types.

Unable to place objects on the grid.
The Pause button doesn't work.
Stubbed togglePause() function to squelch error.

npm warns of these issues when installing locally:
npm WARN deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.
npm WARN deprecated @humanwhocodes/config-array@0.11.14: Use @eslint/config-array instead
npm WARN deprecated rimraf@3.0.2: Rimraf versions prior to v4 are no longer supported
npm WARN deprecated @humanwhocodes/object-schema@2.0.3: Use @eslint/object-schema instead
npm WARN deprecated glob@7.2.3: Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported

I also started work on migrating eslint to a more recent version (Eslint v9+) beginning with the eslintrc config file.

The project should also move to ES modules, although I don't believe anything is CommonJS (except for the .eslintrc.cjs config file).
